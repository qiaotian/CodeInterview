/*
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.
For example,
Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.

class Solution {
public:
    int strobogrammaticInRange(string low, string high) {
        
    }

/*
Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
